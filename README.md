# Cyber Threat Detection using LSTM

This repository contains the training code, dataset, and trained LSTM model for cyber threat detection using the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The model is designed to classify network traffic as benign or malicious, achieving 95.5% accuracy with a 4.6% false positive rate.

## Features

- Deep learning-based cyber threat detection using LSTM
- Preprocessed UNSW-NB15 dataset for efficient training
- High accuracy with a low false positive rate
- Easily extendable for real-time threat monitoring
